I refined the CSS for the pagination component to create a cleaner, more modern design that aligns smoothly with the project’s overall theme. 
The layout now features improved spacing, clearer active states, and smoother hover interactions, making navigation feel more intuitive. With better sizing, typography, and responsiveness, the pagination now looks more polished and enhances the interface with a structured, app-like feel.
