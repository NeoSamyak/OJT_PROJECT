We added audio player controls to the project. This involved enabling essential features such as play, pause, volume adjustment, and progress control. By integrating these functions, we improved the usability of the music player and made the interface more interactive and user-friendly. This task helped enhance the overall functionality of the application and brought it closer to a complete audio experience.
